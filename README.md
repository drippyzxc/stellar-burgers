The Burger-Stellar project is a full-fledged frontend application-shop, with the ability to register, create an order and view both all orders and each order separately. It is also possible to edit your data in the user's personal account.

## Implementation

The main page is divided into 2 parts:
* **Left**: List of all ingredients in the form of cards, available for ordering. Tabs are implemented for convenient switching of ingredient types.
* **Right**: List of ingredients placed in the basket. To place and issue an order number, you must select a burger bun as the basis for the order.

To place an order, you need to log in to your personal account by clicking on the link 'Place an order' or 'Personal account' in the upper right corner. After placing the order, a number will be issued and a modal window will open.
