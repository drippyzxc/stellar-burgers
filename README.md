The Burger-Stellar project is a full-fledged frontend application-shop, with the ability to register, create an order and view both all orders and each order separately. It is also possible to edit your data in the user's personal account.

## Implementation

The main page is divided into 2 parts:
* **Left**: List of all ingredients in the form of cards, available for ordering. Tabs are implemented for convenient switching of ingredient types.
* **Right**: List of ingredients added to the basket. To place an order and receive an order number, you must log in and select a burger bun as the basis for your order.
